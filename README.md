# Temperature-Monitoring-and-Control
This is a temperature control system with fans acting as the coolers and a 100 watt bulb acting as a heater. The user can specify a temperature value between 25 degree celsius and 75 degree celsius and the system will maintain the temperature within the cardboard box, which acts as a room. The LCD panel on the box shows the current temperature and the temperature set by the user. This system is accurate upto a degree celsius.This system is used by a PID controller using arduino.The final code is in the file "FINAL_EVAL2_with_PID.ino"

This is a demo of heating and cooling by the system respectively.
